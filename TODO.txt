* Replace CAN header with JST GH 4-circuit (1.25mm pitch) x 2

* The CAN bus should have 24V on it (to match chair standard) or 5V (to
  match Dronecode Autopilot Connector Standard) but we only have either
  12V available from the chair or 5V from our own regulator UNLESS we
  take a raw 24V input from the chair separately. Decide what to do! I'm
  leaning toward taking a separate 24V input from the chair and passing
  that down the cable. That way it doesn't matter if multiple modules
  supply 24V to the bus, because they're all sourcing it from the same
  place. This may mean modifying the board to add a header for a 24V
  input, unless it's just injected at the header intended for a pin
  jumper to enable 12V bus power right now.

* Make a sub-board for connecting the CAN connectors in the case.
